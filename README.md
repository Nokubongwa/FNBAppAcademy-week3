Hi,

Welcome to Week 3 of the FNB App Academy!



By now, you’ve explored the foundations of app development with HTML and CSS—and even built your first app. That’s a big milestone, so well done! But there’s still a lot more power to unlock in these two tools.



In last Friday’s live lecture, we walked through the Software Development Life Cycle, using our case study app, Pine City Zoo, to explore how developers go from an idea to a full-fledged app. It’s all about planning, designing, and thinking ahead—just like a real dev team would.

Now it’s your turn.



This week, you’ll be building your own version of the Pine City Zoo app. Some parts of it will challenge you, and that’s a good thing. Take your time, revisit the lessons as often as needed, and don’t rush. You’re not just coding—you’re developing real-world skills.
